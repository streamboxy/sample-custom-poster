## Sample Custom Poster Docs

With the Custom Poster Project you can create individual posters for your participants. For Example you can insert the participant-name from the Streamboxy Plattform and can greet every user by his name.

You have only to add some query parameters with the streamboxy-placeholders to the sample url: e.g https://samples.test.streamboxy.com/custom-poster?userName={{userName}}&sessionStartDate={{sessionStartDate}}&sessionTitle={{sessionTitle}}&imgUrl=INSERT_YOUR_IMAGE_URL_HERE

You'll find more details regarding streamboxy placeholders here:
